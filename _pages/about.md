Behind this smiling face lies a researcher in computer science who did his PhD at Bordeaux University (one thing to thank wine for: make the city famous abroad). During my time there, was part of the Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique ([LaBRI](http://www.labri.fr)) and worked in [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/) as a member of the [Potioc](https://team.inria.fr/potioc/) team.

My [thesis]({{ site.url }}/thesis/) started with the evaluation of human-computer interaction through electroencephalography, but quickly I got interested in how physiological sensors could shape our interactions with machines, and ultimately how they could change our relationships with other individuals. If it sounds a vast program it's not my fault: as a former student in cognitive science it's hard not to think outside the box.

After the completion of my PhD was a teaching assistant (ATER) for one semester at the University of Bordeaux and spent some months being a research engineer at Inria, affiliated to the [Athena](https://team.inria.fr/athena/) team. By the end of 2016 I joined [Ullo](http://ullo.fr) as the head of the research and innovation department. This is a opportunity to transfer some of the work done at Inria so it could be used for real, for good. 

Since May 2017, I also joined as a post-doc the [UsLAB](http://hci.idc.ac.il/) at IDC Herzliya, in Israel. Under the supervision of [Jessica Cauchard](http://www.jessicacauchard.com/), I will continue there my research on shared biofeedback, pursuing the vision of implicit interactions and adaptive environment.
