Here I am interested in how we could use physiological signals to help people bond with each others during day life interactions. One practical example comes from a traditional board that was "augmented" through remote heart rate sensing, using webcams. Indeed, heartbeats could be used to [increase social presence](/projects/agents-social-presence/). Projection helped to conceal the technological aspects from users and to seamlessly integrate the biofeedback to players' surroundings.

In a pilot study, various conditions were tested -- e.g. heart rate visible by all players *vs* visible only by others and not by self.
The main hypothesis is that the presence of a biofeedback equally shared between players -- i.e. a heart rate visible by all -- will improve game experience and social presence. The next iteration would improve on the feedback given to players, for example using [Tobe avatars](/projects/tobe/).

The code supporting this application -- notably remote heart rate sensing using off-the-shelf webcams -- is released as an [opensource software](https://github.com/jfrey-xx/PhysioBluffGame.meta). To my knowledge, this is the first time that remote sensing is used for several users, in a social context.
