Stereoscopic displays are going mainstream. You know them, they're often called "3D" displays, they make your movie theatre tickets cost more and frighten parents when their progeny play all day long to 3DS games.

Because of the mechanisms use to give the illusion of depth, fatigue or even pain could occur in particular occasions. In order to mitigate those symptoms and enable systems to automatically adapt to users, we use EEG (electroencephalography) to measure visual comfort in near real-time. Recordings of brain activity help to evaluate various components of human-computer interaction, for the sake of a better user experience -- see the the dedicated project that [assesses several constructs at once](/projects/eval/).
