My program for CHI '17: give [BCI courses with with my colleagues from Potioc](https://team.inria.fr/potioc/bci-courses/) (still time to register!), [demonstrate an actuated and updated version of Teegi](https://vimeo.com/206059504) and listen to [Joan Sol Roo](http://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/jroo/), who will present the [Inner Garden, an augmented sandbox for mindfulness](/projects/inner_garden/) -- we were lucky enough to get a "best paper honorable mention" :)
