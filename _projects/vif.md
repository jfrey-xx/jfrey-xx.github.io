Combining head-mounted displays, physiological signals and brain activity for... interactive fictions?? A text-based immersive story that adapts to your inner state; a stupid idea I'm most proud of. More information to come about this working prototype and the rationale behind, a [dedicated page](http://phd.jfrey.info/vif/) is up in the meantime.
