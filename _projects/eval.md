The measure of brain activity by the mean of electroencephalography (EEG) is mature enough to assess mental states. Combined with existing methods, such tool can be used to strengthen the understanding of user experience. We contribute a set of methods to estimate continuously various constructs, such as workload, attention level and the recognition of interaction errors. We validate these measures on a controlled virtual environment and show how they can be used to compare interaction techniques and interfaces. Thanks to such framework, EEG becomes a promising method to improve the overall usability of computer systems.

This work had been the starting point of my thesis -- before I delved more into how physiological computing could not only enhance existing interface, but create brand new ways to interact with people. Here the goal is to give a clear and detailed method for any HCI researcher to benefit from EEG.
