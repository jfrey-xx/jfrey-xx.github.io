Behind this smiling face lies a PhD student in computer science at Bordeaux University (one thing to thank wine for: make the city famous abroad). I'm part of the Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique ([LaBRI](http://www.labri.fr)) and work in [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/) as a member of the [Potioc](https://team.inria.fr/potioc/) team.

My thesis focuses on the evaluation of human-computer interaction through electroencephalography, but more broadly I'm interested in how physiological sensors could shape our interactions with machines, and ultimately how they could change our relationships with other individuals. If it sounds a vast program it's not my fault: as a former student in cognitive science it's hard not to think outside the box.

## Contact

I'm an old-fashioned guy, if you want to shoot me -- and don't hesitate to! -- you'll have to do it with an e-mail: jeremy dot frey at inria dot fr (take that, spam bots!).
