Behind this smiling face lies a researcher in computer science at Bordeaux University (one thing to thank wine for: make the city famous abroad). I'm part of the Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique ([LaBRI](http://www.labri.fr)) and work in [Inria](http://www.inria.fr/en/) as a member of the [Potioc](https://team.inria.fr/potioc/) team.

My [thesis]({{ site.url }}/thesis/) started with the evaluation of human-computer interaction through electroencephalography, but quickly I got interested in how physiological sensors could shape our interactions with machines, and ultimately how they could change our relationships with other individuals. If it sounds a vast program it's not my fault: as a former student in cognitive science it's hard not to think outside the box.

If you want to shoot me -- and don't hesitate to! -- write an e-mail jeremy dot frey at inria dot fr (take that, spam bots!). 

Even though I'm the kind of guy that suffers from a 140 characters limit, I sporadically post on Twitter: [@jfrey_xx](https://twitter.com/jfrey_xx).
